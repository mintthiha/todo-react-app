##### Why NextJS?

So initially I tried creating the project using only React, With _create-react-app_, but I ran into issues regarding conflicting dependencies. I then went on to try Vite and React, but I also faced issues, but this time with **Tailwind**. Since I want to use **shadcn**, I decided to now use **NextJS**.
